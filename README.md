# TODO -Kotlin

Hi all, this is to do app that created for store and edit TO DO list with a countdown timer.
The apps can store the data locally and can checked for more intraction.

## Reasoning
This project was created in Android Kotlin as it has null safety build in. 
The project is on android and will work as a base if want to be converted into hybrid(flutter)

## Tech that used in the application

In this project the achitecture that use was MVVM so it can update the ui reactively.
Other tech/concept was used is Dagger for injection, PaperDB for Database, ViewModel for data distribution,
RXJava for crashed preventor and avoid memeory leaks, custom text view, and appXBus.

## Future Improvement.

1. Using flutter so can run for both Android/IOS and will be using BLoC but same MVVM pattern.
2. Using ROOM database in place of PaperDB
3. Using jetpack for dynamic ui implementation
4. Added release key for release build
5. Using APIs to store data in the server so it will be easy to access.



## Requirement

1. Tested on Android Studio 4.1.3
2. Deployed on Android Phone 
3. Window/ Mac to run IDE application
